<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE<br/>
<small>TO THE THIRD SERIES.</small></h2>


This Series of Toys contains a more extensive and
minute description of Animals, Birds, Fishes, Articles
of Manufacture, &amp;c. than was given in the First and
Second Series.

<p>This Series is intended for a larger class of my
young friends than the preceding ones; and, it is
hoped they will be both benefited and amused by
their perusal.</p>

<p>In this as well as in all the other Series nothing has
been permitted to find a place which is false, unnatural,
or unphilosophical, or any details of conversations
among animals which never <i>did</i>, and which never <i>can</i>
take place.</p>

<p>It is believed that in the large field of Nature and
Art, there are sufficient materials for descriptions and
stories without launching into the field of Fiction and
Falsehood, to find subjects which will be interesting
to children.</p>

<p>To remove difficulties in the reading of these Stories
as far as possible, and thereby render them more interesting,
the language used in the descriptions is limited
to words of <span class="smcap">ONE</span>, <span class="smcap">TWO</span>, and <span class="smcap">THREE SYLLABLES</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="ALWAYS_SPEAK_THE_TRUTH" id="ALWAYS_SPEAK_THE_TRUTH"></a>ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">George Washington</span>, late President
of the United States, always spoke the
truth. During his whole life he had
great regard for truth, and was never
known, under any circumstance, to
make a false statement.</p>

<p>When he was about six years old, a
friend of his gave him a hatchet. George
thought it a very fine present and was
constantly going about, chopping every
thing that came in his way.</p>

<p>One very pleasant morning, he walked
out into his father's garden with his
hatchet in his hand. It was a beautiful
garden, in which were flowers, of various
kinds, such as pinks, lilies, lilachs,
roses, &amp;c. which greeted the eye at
every step. George was delighted with
the prospect around him.</p>

<p>In the east end of the garden was a
quantity of pea-bushes which had been
placed there by his excellent mother.
These bushes were dry and dead so that
the hacking of George's hatchet on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
them did not do much hurt, except to
weaken their strength and make them
less able to bear the weight of peas that
might grow on the pea-vines.</p>

<p>But George had the misfortune
thoughtlessly to try the edge of his
hatchet on the body of a beautiful young
English cherry-tree which he injured so
much that it scarcely if ever got over it.</p>

<p>On the following morning his papa,
in his walk in the garden, observed the
injury done to his favourite cherry-tree,
and after walking awhile, returned to
the house, and inquired of the different
members of the family whether any of
them knew who had done the mischief,
remarking, at the same time, that he
would not have taken five dollars for
the tree. No one was able to inform
him, for there was no person in the garden
with George when he cut the tree.</p>

<p>Presently George made his appearance
with his hatchet in his hand.</p>

<p>"George," said his papa, "do you
know who killed that beautiful little
cherry-tree yonder in the garden?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

  <div class="caption"><p><i>Little George with his Hatchet in his
hand, and his Papa pointing to the
ruined Cherry-tree.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was an unpleasant question, and
George staggered under it for a moment;
then looking at his papa, he bravely
cried out "I can not tell a lie, papa;
you know I can not tell a lie, I did it
with my little hatchet!" "Run to my
arms, my dearest boy", said his papa,
"you have paid me for my tree a thousand
times; I freely forgive you for killing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
it; and I hope my son will always
be hero enough to tell the truth, let
what will come."</p>

<p>I hope all my young friends will be
as honest as little George Washington
was, and remember <i>always to speak the</i>
<span class="smcap">Truth</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TWO_COTTAGE_GIRLS" id="THE_TWO_COTTAGE_GIRLS"></a>THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a delightful town in New England,
there lived a family of the name
of Davis. Their residence was in a
neat little cottage in a beautiful valley
on the bank of a river, whose waters
glided smoothly by the side of their
humble but happy mansion. Mr.
Davis had two daughters who were
twins. Mrs. Davis took great pains to
dress them alike, and always to have
them make a neat appearance. Their
names were Helen and Maria. In
pleasant, warm weather, they often took
a walk by the river, and were much
pleased with the delightful groves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
scenery, which their handsome valley
presented to their view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
  <img src="images/pg7img.png" width="391" height="345" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>Helen and Maria meet an old Gentleman
with his little Dog by his side.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>One fine morning they were neatly
dressed by their mamma, and walked
out as usual. A short distance from
the house, they met an old gentleman
who was very kind, wealthy, and friendly,
and very fond of good children. His
residence was in a very splendid mansion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
in a village about two miles from
the cottage of Mr. Davis. He wore a
plain coat and an old-fashioned hat.
Owing to his advanced age, he made
use of spectacles&mdash;all which gave him
a very grave appearance. The girls,
who were then about ten years of age,
had been taught by their good and excellent
mamma, that aged people who
conduct themselves properly, should always
be treated with kindness, respect,
and attention. They, therefore, as they
came near the old gentleman, made a
polite and modest courtesy to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker, (which was the name
of the old gentleman), spoke very kindly
to the girls, and inquired about their
health and other matters connected
with their family. Helen, who was not
as diffident as Maria, answered Mr.
Walker very frankly and modestly, and
in such an artless manner that he was
much pleased.</p>

<p>He inquired of them whether they
would not prefer a residence in the village.
They both informed him, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
they chose rather to remain in their
cottage than in any other place. They
had all the comforts of life; and there
they were able to take a walk by the
side of their delightful river. They
could also raise their own fowls and
milk their own cows, all which was
very nice sport for them.</p>

<p>They said there were many things
which people who live in the village
have that they, in their humble cottage,
could not have; yet they were quite
happy, as they never wished for any
thing which their kind parents were not
able to furnish them.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was quite surprised
at their candid and simple manners,
as well as their wise and discreet
remarks, and left them, and returned
home, fully convinced that people who
live in cottages may be happy, though
they are poor, if they are only contented.</p>

<p>All young persons should remember,
that contentment renders every good
thing that we may enjoy doubly sweet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and that, without contentment, they
would be wretched, if they had the
richest palace for a dwelling.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="ELIZA_AND_HARRIET" id="ELIZA_AND_HARRIET"></a>ELIZA AND HARRIET.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Eliza</span> and Harriet were two very
lovely girls. Eliza was twelve years
old, and Harriet, her little sister, was
six years old. Eliza was a very kind
and good girl, and extremely fond of
her little sister Harriet; who was also
a sweet, pleasant child. Whenever
their mamma purchased any thing for
Eliza, or if she had a present of any
thing, she always divided it equally
with Harriet; and, if she wished any
of her playthings, she would at once
lend them to her, and never quarrel
with her, or tease her.</p>

<p>The house in which they lived stood
on a pleasant and delightful spot, from
which all the surrounding country could
be viewed. In rear of the house stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a beautiful and stately sugar maple-tree,
the branches of which spread over
nearly all of the yard, and extended
over a part of the roof of the house.
Under this large tree, Eliza and Harriet
spent a great deal of time, when
they were not in school and the weather
was pleasant. There they sometimes
amused themselves with their dolls and
other playthings, and sometimes Eliza
would amuse Harriet with little stories
which had been told to her, or which
she had read in her little books. When
they took a walk together, Eliza would
take Harriet by the hand, and lead her
along very carefully, always keeping
her out of the dirt and wet places.</p>

<p>One fine morning they arose very
early, and took a walk to inhale the
pure air of the hills and mountains,
just as the sun came forth to look upon
the beauties of creation, while the lark
soared high above them on its happy
wings. Eliza was delighted with the
sight; and, putting her left hand gently
on Harriet's shoulder, pointed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Lark with her right hand. Harriet
took off her bonnet, and put up her right
hand to screen her eyes from the dazzling
rays of the sun, while she looked
at the beautiful bird. After they had
walked a little farther, they returned
home very cheerful and much refreshed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>One day her little sister Harriet
wished her to teach her how to sew.
So Eliza very patiently threaded the
needle for her, made the knots in the
ends of the thread, and basted down
the hems for her, until Harriet was able
to do these things herself.</p>

<p>Eliza takes care of her own clothes
and always folds them up neatly, and
shows her little sister to do so too; and,
therefore, she knows where they are
and can find them in the dark as well
as in the light. When she and Harriet
come home from school, she takes
the school books out of the basket, and
puts them in their proper place, and
never leaves them scattered about, to
be in the way of her mamma.</p>

<p>Eliza and Harriet were both such
excellent children, that their mamma
scarcely ever had any occasion to chide
them or find fault with them; and, all
who were acquainted with them, esteemed
them very highly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huldah Jones</span> is a very cross and
peevish little girl. When she wishes
any thing, she always whines or frets
at the time she asks for it; and, never
speaks in a pleasant manner.</p>

good morning, or sets off cheerful
and happy as good girls do. I hope
none of my young female friends are

<h2><a name="THE_IMPRUDENT_BOY" id="THE_IMPRUDENT_BOY"></a>THE IMPRUDENT BOY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> was always inclined to do
what was not prudent, and would not
mind what was said to him. At one
time he would get upon the window-seat,
and be in imminent danger of
falling out of the window; at another
time he would climb up on the back of
a chair, so as to be in danger of falling
when the person should rise who was
sitting on the chair.</p>

<p>One day Peter wished to have some
apples; and, his mamma told him that
she would send for some to the orchard
as soon as the hired man should come
in to his dinner. Peter, who was then
but six years old, told his mamma, that
he could climb the tree and get some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
himself. His mamma answered him,
that she feared he would fall and hurt
him badly. He waited a few moments
for the man to come; and, as soon as
his mamma was out of sight, ran to the
orchard, got into one of the trees, fell,
and broke his arm. Poor Peter wept
bitterly, when the Doctor came to set
the broken bone!</p>
